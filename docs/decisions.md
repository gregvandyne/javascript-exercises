# Decisions

One line each: the choice, then why. **Bold = please confirm** (product calls that are expensive to reverse).

## Owner requests that change the original brief
- **Name: "Magic Cup"** (was "BRB Gaming", before that "Playloom"). Every visible name, the logo (a gold cup), the browser icon, page titles, Builder and safety copy, docs and the official account (`MagicCup`, renamed in place from `BRBGaming` by the seed so its games keep their owner) say Magic Cup. Internal technical names stay as they were: the game SDK global `window.BRB` and `brb:*` messages (every existing game calls them), `BRB_*` env vars, the `brb_session` cookie and `brb.db`. — Owner asked to rename the site; renaming the SDK would break every published game and renaming env vars/cookies would break the deploy and sign everyone out.
- New Render service `magic-cup` (https://magic-cup.onrender.com) replaces `brb-gaming`: Render can't change an existing service's onrender.com subdomain. — Owner asked for the onrender domain to change too.
- **Name: "BRB Gaming"** (was "Playloom"). SDK global is `window.BRB`, messages are `brb:*`, env vars are `BRB_*`, official account is `BRBGaming`. — Owner asked to rename.
- **Friends-only chat added** (brief said no chat). Text chat only between accepted friends (added by friend code), both with real accounts, filtered for profanity and personal info (phones, emails, links, addresses, "add me on snap"), quick-chat phrase chips for young kids, rate limits + daily cap, block, report → admin queue, grown-ups can switch chat off on the Me page. No public, group or stranger chat. — Owner asked for a way for users to chat; this is the safest version that meets it.
- **Updating published games is first-class.** The Studio shows "Live: vN · Editing: vM" and an "Update live game" button; for Public games the update is reviewed while players keep the old version (`games.pending_version_id`). — Owner asked that builders can update games they already published.
- **Inspiration uploads in the Studio** (photos, drawings, text files, PDFs). They are private to the builder and admins, metadata such as photo GPS is stripped, and images are screened when an API key is set. They are given to the Builder as reference only and never copied into games, so no real photos of kids end up in public games. — Owner asked for uploads for inspiration.
- Home hero shows only the featured game; "Make your own game" is its own banner below the Featured rail. — Owner feedback: mixing them in one card was confusing.
- The GitHub repository itself could not be renamed from this session (no repo-settings tool); rename it in GitHub → Settings → General. Everything inside the repo is renamed.

- **Two more launch games: Connect Four and an 18-hole mini golf homage to *Happy Gilmore*.** The golf course mimics the movie's gags (hockey slap-shot tee, the laughing clown's mouth, the alligator pond, grandma's house, the happy place, the TV-tower finale) but uses no character names or likenesses and no brands, so it stays kid-safe and copyright-safe; the description names the movie as the inspiration. Connect Four uses an original title (the "Connect 4" name is a trademark). — Owner asked for a connect-four game and a mini golf course from a famous movie or show ("just pick one"); Happy Gilmore is the best-known golf movie with an actual mini-golf scene and a 2025 sequel.
- Seed games are listed once in `scripts/seed.js` (`SEED_GAMES`) and the scanner tests read the same list of slugs. — One place to add a launch game.

## Revenue and models
- **Builder share 70% of ad revenue, eCPM 200¢ (house ads), payout threshold $10** — brief defaults, configurable via env; needs owner sign-off.
- **Builder model `claude-sonnet-5-5`, "Pro quality" uses `claude-opus-5-5`; screening/review classifier uses a small model** — brief defaults; cost vs quality is the owner's call.

## Engineering
- Account security: bcrypt cost 11; login compares against a dummy hash for unknown names (no timing leak) and gives one message for wrong name or password; the 50 most common passwords, one repeated character, and passwords containing the username are refused; the session id is rotated when a guest becomes an account; expired sessions are swept hourly; concurrent sign-ups with the same name get a friendly error. — Owner asked that new accounts are stored and secure.
- Express 5 + server-rendered HTML + vanilla ES modules, no build step. — Brief default; fast first paint on cheap phones.
- SQLite (better-sqlite3, WAL) behind `q` and service modules. — Brief default; Postgres swap stays a repository-layer change.
- Reused the starter's schema/auth/games/presence; rewrote: `canView` now also respects report auto-hide; added `pending_version_id`, `hidden_reason`, version `review_status`, chat tables, `users.chat_enabled`; bounded all filter regexes after a 2 MB input hung the scanner.
- Nunito is self-hosted from `@fontsource/nunito` instead of Google Fonts. — No third-party requests from the site itself (privacy) and no external CSP host.
- Site CSP has no inline scripts; page data goes in `<script type="application/json">`. — Strict CSP for the site, separate stricter CSP for game frames.
- Game frames are reached by a short-lived signed token URL (`/frame/<token>`), not cookies. — Frames are opaque-origin; the token carries version + viewer and expires in 6 h.
- The SDK is inlined into each frame. — The frame CSP only allows inline scripts + cdnjs, and `'self'` means nothing in an opaque origin.
- localStorage inside games is replaced by a synchronous in-memory shim pre-seeded with the cloud save and debounce-synced through the parent. — Opaque-origin frames cannot use real localStorage; existing games (seeds) just work.
- Scanner levels: `fail` blocks all sharing; `flag` (e.g. flashing, hidden text) allows Private/Friends but always needs a human before Public. — Brief says flashing is "flagged"; a human should decide.
- Publishing Public without an API key always goes to the human review queue. — Brief: if the model is unavailable, wait for a human.
- An already-approved version is not re-reviewed when visibility changes back to Public. — Same bytes, same verdict.
- One-tap play: opening `/play/...` without a session creates a guest (rate-limited per IP). — "Play as a guest in one tap", and saves work from the first game.
- Friends and chat require a real (non-guest) account; guests can play, rate, like and report. — Guest identities are throwaway; friendships and messages need accountability.
- Report auto-hide counts distinct reporters, ignores the owner, threshold `REPORTS_TO_HIDE` (3). — Brief rule; distinct users stop one person hiding a game.
- Saves are a string→string map per user per game, max 500 KB. — Matches the localStorage shape; bounded.
- Presence is in-memory per process (75 s TTL, 30 s heartbeat). — Brief rule; a multi-instance deploy would need Redis (roadmap).
- Rate limits are in-memory per process. — Fine for one instance; same Redis note.
- Ratings sort uses a Bayesian average (prior 3★ × 2) for "Top rated". — Stops one 5★ vote topping the chart.
